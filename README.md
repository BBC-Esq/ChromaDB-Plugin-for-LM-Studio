1) üêç[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/) or [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/)
2) üìÅ[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) üìÅ[Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com/).
4) üåê[Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases).
5) Build Tools.
   > Certain dependencies don't have pre-compiled "wheels" so you must build them.  Therefore, you must install something that can build source code such as [Microsoft Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and/or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).  If you decide to use both of these programs in conjunction, make sure to select the "Desktop development with C++" extension and check the four boxes on the right containing "SDK."

6) üü¢Nvidia GPU acceleration requires [CUDA 12.1+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

<div align="center"> <h2>INSTALLATION</h2></div>

<details>
  <summary>ü™üWINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS</summary>
  
### Step 1
üü¢ Nvidia GPU ‚ûú Install CUDA 12.1+

üî¥ AMD GPU - (AMD GPU acceleration support coming in future releases).
### Step 2
Navigate to a directory on your computer, open a command prompt and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ChromaDB-Plugin-for-LM-Studio.git
```
  * Alternatively, you can [download the latest release](https://github.com/BBC-Esq/ChromaDB-Plugin-for-LM-Studio/releases/latest), open the ZIP file, and copy the contents to a folder on your computer.
### Step 3
Navigate to the ```src``` folder, open a command prompt, and create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .
```
### Step 4
Activate the virtual environment:
```
.\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 5
Run setup:
```
python setup.py
```

### Optional Step 6
Run this command if you want to doublecheck that you installed the Pytorch and gpu-acceleration software correctly:
```
python check_gpu.py
```

  <summary>üêßLINUX INSTRUCTIONS</summary>

Linux users must use Release v3.5.2 until I can update the codebase due to recent major changes.  Download the ZIP file for that release and follow the instructions in the readme.md.

  <summary>üçéAPPLE INSTRUCTIONS</summary>

MacOS users must use Release v3.5.2 until I can update the codebase due to recent major changes.  Download the ZIP file for that release and follow the instructions in the readme.md.

<div align="center"> <h2>USING THE PROGRAM</h2></div>
<details>
  <summary>üñ•Ô∏èINSTRUCTIONSüñ•</summary>

## Activate Virtual Environment
* Once you install the program you've already created a virtual environment, so you just need to activate it each time you want to restart it.  Remember to run the appropriate command to do so (based on your platform) within the ```src``` folder.
## Start the Program
```
python gui.py
```
> Only systems with an Nvidia GPU will display gpu power, usage, and VRAM metrics.

# üî•Importantüî•
* Read the User Guide before sending me questions.

## Download Vector Model
* In the ```Models Tab``` tab, choose the embedding model you want to download.  The ```User Guide Tab``` contains information about the various models.

## Create a Vector Database
* In the ```Create Database``` tab, click ```Choose Files``` and select one or more files to add.  This can be repeated as many times as you wish.
  * Supported documents are: ```.pdf```, ```.docx```, ```.epub```, ```.txt```, ```.html```, ```.enex```, ```.eml```, ```.msg```, ```.csv```, ```.xls```, ```.xlsx```, ```.rtf```, ```.odt```.
* If you selected any image files, I highly recommend that you adjust the vision model settings within the ```Settings``` tab and testing the settings while processing a single image, which can easily be done within the ```Tools``` tab.
  * Supported images are: ```.png```, ```.jpg```, ```.jpeg```, ```.bmp```, ```.gif```, ```.tif```, ```.tiff```
* üî• To add audio files you must transcribe one or more audio files from the ```Tools Tab```.  The transcriptions will be saved and added when you create the vector database.
  * Supported audio extensions include, but are not limited to: ```.mp3```, ```.wav```, ```.m4a```, ```.ogg```, ```.wma```
* Click ```Choose Model```.
* Click üî•ONCEüî• on the directory containing the vector model you want to use and then click "OK."
* In the input box, enter a name for the database you want to create (accepts numbers, lowercase letters, and the characters "-" or "_").
* In the ```Settings Tab```, set the chunk size, chunk overlap, and the device you want to use.  More information is in the User Guide.
* Click the ```Create Vector Database``` button.
  * üî• MAKE SURE to wait until the command prompt states that the database has been successfully created before proceeding.

## Delete a Database
* In the ```Manage Databases``` tab, select a database from the pulldown menu and click ```Delete Database.```
  > The ability to delete one or more specific files is coming soon.

## Query a Database (No LM Studio)
* In the ```Query Database``` tab, select the database you want to use from the pulldown menu.
* Enter your question by typing it or using the ```Record Question``` button.
* Check the ```chunks only``` checkbox.
* Click ```Submit Question```, which will return chunks relevant to your query.
  * In the ```Settings``` tab, you can change multiple settings regarding querying the database.  More information can be found in the User Guide.

## Query a Database with a Response From LM Studio
This program can get relevant chunks from the vector database and forwarding them - along with your question - to LM Studio for an answer!
* Perform the above steps regarding entering a question and choosing settings, but make sure that ```Chunks Only``` is üî•UNCHECKEDüî•.
* Start LM Studio and go to the Server tab on the left.
* Turn ```Apply Prompt Formatting``` to "OFF."
* On the right side within ```Prompt Format```, make sure that all of the following settings are blank:
  * ```System Message Prefix```
  * ```System Message Suffix```
  * ```User Message Prefix```
  * ```User Message Suffix```
* At the top, load a model within LM Studio.
* On the right, adjust the ```GPU Offload``` setting to your liking.
* Within my program, go to the ```Settings``` tab, select the appropriate prompt format for the model loaded in LM Studio, click ```Update Settings```.
* In LM Studio,  click ```Start Server.```
* In the ```Query Database``` tab, click ```Submit Question```.

<div align="center"> <h2>CLOSING ARGUMENT</h2></div>
  
* This program uses fun "Bark" models to convert the response to audio.  However, you must wait until the ENTIRE response is received before clicking the ```Bark Response``` button.
  * I plan on adding support for the ```WhisperSpeech``` library as well, and I highly recommend that you [check it out](https://github.com/collabora/WhisperSpeech).
* The voice recorder and audio file transcriber use the amazing ```WhisperS2T``` library, which I highly recommend [that you check out](https://github.com/shashikg/WhisperS2T).
* The "vision" models used in this program generate summaries of pictures, which are then added to the vector database.  I wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@vici0549/search-images-with-vector-database-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-3d5a48881de5) regarding this.  Support for ```llava v1.6``` is coming just as soon as the ```transformers``` library officially supports it!
